## **Introduction**
I'm a 4th year Computer Science major who is mostly interested in game design. In my off time, I like to program small games that I think would be fun to play once in a while. Other than programming, I like to play video games and read Japanese manga. I look forward to learning about how to work in groups in this class because I have had no prior experience with working with others. I believe that working on groups is essential, especially in game design.
## **Favorite Video Games**
I have played many different video games, but there are a few that I still keep playing till this day and are on the top of my list of favorite games. MY top three favorite as of the time of writing this would be:
1. [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/)
2. [Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends)
3. [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us)
I have only recently picked up Apex Legends, but it is becoming a game that I enjoy to play along with my friends.
## **[GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker)**
What I have been interested in during my experience with programming was creating games. I have always enjoyed playing videog games and I have recently begun to appreciate the process behind the creation of games. During my high school years, I started to create my own miniature video games using GameMaker Studio, which gives an easy way to create games. The programming language also has ways to write code specifically for changing sprites, objects, audio, and more. For example, you can change the pitch of audio with `audio_sound_pitch()`. An example of this would be [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yoyogames.com%2Fen%2Fblog%2Fbest-practices-when-coding-in-gamemaker-studio-2&psig=AOvVaw1-2PRQPTisaC6rfSnVxjtE&ust=1632715144854000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCNjWgITgm_MCFQAAAAAdAAAAABA6).
## Conclusion
This year, I hope to
- Learn how to work in groups

- Start early, start often
And also
- [x] Finish this lab.
