## Introduction
I'm a 4th year Computer Science major who is mostly interested in game design. In my off time, I like to program small games that I think would be fun to play once in a while. Other than programming, I like to play video games and read Japanese manga. I look forward to learning about how to work in groups in this class because I have had no prior experience with working with others. I believe that working on groups is essential, especially in game design.
## Favorite Video Games
I have played many different video games, but there are a few that I still keep playing till this day and are on the top of my list of favorite games. MY top three favorite as of the time of writing this would be:
1. [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/)
2. [Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends)
3. [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us)
I have only recently picked up Apex Legends, but it is becoming a game that I enjoy to play along with my friends.
